# MCW — Implementation Status

Last updated: March 22, 2026

## Current State

The project has shipped through `v1.3.0` on `main`.

Current `main` has begun the post-`v1.3.0`
**Cryptanalysis Workspace** line.

Established and shipped:
- implementation contract and AI coordination protocol
- engine core type definitions, graph validation, param validation
- iterative topological executor
- V1 primitive module set (symbol + bit domains, bridges, modern primitives)
- hybrid reference pipeline tests
- reducer-backed UI shell with visual workbench canvas
- add / delete / move / connect editor fundamentals
- module-role color coding in palette and canvas
- structured parameter editors for `bits` and `wiring`
- workbench persistence (autosave/restore + JSON import/export)
- sticky-note annotations
- dark mode token groundwork
- reusable composite workflows (composite V1 contract)
- analysis/debugging visibility and step-through execution
- signal-path trace filtering
- comparison-first break workflows
- guided challenges
- modern primitive expansion (LFSR, SBox, Permutation, BitShifter)
- tutorial walkthrough system with reducer-backed session state
- signal probing (pin/unpin live module I/O in Analyze tab)
- ticked execution engine (`StatefulModuleDef`, `TickSliceableModuleDef`, `executeTickedProject`)
- per-tick source slicing (TextInput, BitSource) and `deriveTickCount`
- ticked execution UI (tick bar, scrubber, collected output, per-tick inspector state)
- Build / Guide workspace mode (per-project, persisted)
- stateful composite ticking support
- challenge capture / export workflow
- sequential challenge evaluation and divergence reporting
- advanced modern foundry primitives and labs
- multi-format bridges (`HexSource`, `BitsToHex`, `AsciiSource`, `BitsToAscii`)
- historical bridges and Lorenz-style labs
- constrained iterators and key-bus distribution
- nested analysis for composites and iterators
- Feistel round / iterator teaching loop
- lightweight cryptanalysis instrumentation in Compare
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Locked In Code

The following decisions are reflected in shipped code:
- iterative topological execution (V1: stateless; V1.1+: ticked stateful wrapper)
- required graph validation before execution
- minimal `ParamSchema`
- `advance` is pure and opt-in per module (Rotor ships with advance)
- `tickSlice` / `tickLength` are module-provided, not executor-provided
- workspace mode (`'build' | 'guide'`) gates tutorial overlays without clearing tutorial state
- iterator execution is bounded, linear, and auto-unrolled
- round-key distribution is explicit signal flow, not hidden executor mutation
- nested trace visibility is hoisted into `analysisTrace`, not hidden inside black-box execution

## Stable Releases on `main`

| Tag | Milestone |
|---|---|
| `v0.2.0` | Primitive engine |
| `v0.4.0` | Minimal UI shell |
| `v0.5.0` | Composite workflow |
| `v0.6.0` | Analysis visibility |
| `v0.7.0` | Break workflow |
| `v0.8.0` | Guided challenges |
| `v1.0.0` | V1 milestone complete |
| `v1.0.1` | Post-v1 polish (probes, analysis hardening, header compact) |
| `v1.1.0` | Ticked execution, stateful foundry, sequential labs |
| `v1.2.0` | Modern foundry, bridges, dependent clocking |
| `v1.3.0` | Cipher architecture |

Post-`v1.3.0` work merged to `main`:
- protected built-in architectures and duplicate-as-custom flow
- composite vs iterator palette split
- lightweight text cryptanalysis in Compare

## Safe Next Tasks

### Claude

Safe to begin:
- `feature/cryptanalysis-workspace-vigenere`
- cryptanalysis workspace contract and shell
- reusable English frequency/reference data
- Vigenere-focused key-length and column-analysis tooling

Should avoid for now:
- feedback loops / cycles in the graph
- async or real-time execution
- custom scripting for advance functions
- hidden iterator/key-schedule magic
- automated cracking/search as the first cryptanalysis slice

### Gemini

Safe to begin:
- review whether Cryptanalysis should be its own workspace
- critique the product boundary between Compare and Cryptanalysis
- validate Vigenere as the first classical attack workflow
- help sequence future cryptanalysis families after Vigenere

Best focus:
- whether the first cryptanalysis milestone is bounded correctly
- whether analysis should remain classical-only at first
- whether any important discovery tool is missing from the Vigenere first pass

---

## Current Verification State

Available checks:
- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

All three pass as of the current post-`v1.3.0` line.

## Architect Notes

The canonical hybrid reference machine remains:

```text
TextInput -> Rotor -> Reflector -> Rotor -> SymbolToBits -> XOR -> BitsToSymbol -> Output
```

### Near-Term Roadmap

1. **Cryptanalysis workspace contract** — lock the product boundary before adding UI
2. **Workspace shell** — add a dedicated Cryptanalysis mode
3. **Vigenere first pass** — IOC, repeated patterns, period hints, column analysis
4. **Post-Vigenere direction** — broader classical attack tooling, then possibly modern analysis lines
